The benchmark dataset named BTP640 contains 320 bitter and non-bitter peptides, respectively. 

To validate the generalized ability of the predictive model, the BTP640 dataset was randomly divided into training (named BTP-CV) and independent sets (named BTP-TS) with a ratio of 8:2. Herein, the BTP-CV dataset consisted of 256 bitter and non-bitter peptides, while the BTP-TS dataset consisted of 64 bitter and non-bitter peptides.
