A high-quality dataset consisting of 313 PVPs and 957 non-PVPs was constructed. 

In order to obtain a balanced dataset, the set of non-PVPs was reduced from 957 to 313 non-PVPs. 

Finally, a balanced benchmarking dataset constitutes equal numbers of PVPs and non-PVPs at 313 sequences each. 

So as to avoid overestimation in the prediction model, the benchmark dataset was randomly divided into training (named PVP-CV) and independent sets (named PVP-TS) using the 80/20 split ratio. 

In this work, the PVP-CV dataset consisted of 250 PVPs and non-PVPs, while the PVP-TS dataset consisted of 63 PVPs and non-PVPs
